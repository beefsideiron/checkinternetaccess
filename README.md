# checkinternetaccess

Due to spotty loss of internet connection I wanted time / date etc. for my isp support and get a general idea of what was happening and when. This will simply output if connection is fine or not while adding a traceroute in the log.

perl checkconnection.pl

enter url or ip

choose duration in minutes (0 for forever)

choose run in background or not (y/n). If no it will ouput results.
